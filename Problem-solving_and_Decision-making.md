#Problem Solving and Decision making

* Talking out loud is overpowered
* Talking to a Socratic duck is great
* Decision making: steer towards the cruxes and aggressively see if you can get that info
* TAP: Notice frustration -> summarize the situation out loud
* If you say that you can't do something -> state explicitly what the blocker is, and why it might be a blocker.
* Set 5 minute timers to brainstorm ideas
* Flag when you're pursuing an avenue that isn't cruxy
* Notice when you're thinking the same thought again, and ask what feels unsettled such that you are thinking this again.
* Notice when you have circular dependencies or cycles in your chain of thought, and draw them out.
