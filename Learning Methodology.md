#Learning Methodology



###Deliberate Practice Heuristics and Strategies

- Focus intently 
- Find the limits of your ability
- Fix your errors
- Feedback

####Focus

My juggling times are noticeably weaker when I'm distracted by other things on my mind, such as an essay that I'm writing in my head, or additions that I want to make to this document.

####Deliberate practice is about 50% sitting down with paper / thinky work / theoretical work


* Describing your model of what's happening
* Describing your model of the learning process
* Delineating what's going wrong
* brainstorming interventions to try


####First do it right, then do it smooth, then do it quiet, then do it fast

Epistemic status:

####What gets measured gets managed

Maintaining an a focused intention is easier said than done. All to often I'll set out to practice some specific sub-skill or to focus on some specific aspect of a practice, only to implicitly be motivated to focus on something else, or to slide into mindless repetition.

(Link to my thing about inner intention and outer intention?)

The simplest way that I know of to address this is to simply track and record your performance at the specific metric at which I want to improve. Somehow, doing this incentives the part of me that directs my inner intention.

Importantly, *just* setting up tracking is usually not sufficient. I still need to intentionally make a point to on the activity and have the intention of succeeding at the activity. I still have to try.

Examples:

* Touch Typing: I was "focusing on accuracy" for (weeks? months?) with my touch typing, but inevitably I would feel some pressure / temptation to go fast. This is unsurprising, since I was recording my speeds for each trial. Even if I was wanting to slow down and focus on accuracy, I was hedonically rewarded for fast trial times. Only after I started recording my accuracy scores in the spreadsheet, did that become my actual in-the-moment target, and did my accuracy improve. (link)
* Juggling: I was plateauing with juggling for more than a month. I did a session in which I logged how long, in minutes, I was able to hold the juggling pattern for. In that session, I broke 60 seconds (for the first time) multiple times, and my best time was 50% than my record-to-date. (link)

####Smaller, even smaller

Juggling: I could juggle at all, but the arcs that the balls were traveling were not smooth or consistent. I knew that I should back up to practicing tossing only one ball, one at a time, in a consistent arc, but I despaired of this actually working - it felt like I could do hundreds of repetitions without improving at all. 


That despair was a hint that I hadn't chunked out the exercise enough. I thought that I couldn't get any more basic than that at controlling the trajectory of the ball. But actually I needed have backed up even further, to just throwing the ball straight up in the air, at a consistent height, and catching it, or to throwing it at a target on the ground. [2021-09-18 note: I still need to do this, actually]

####Finding Control Systems

Epistemic status:

Examples:

- **Touch typing** - In learning touch typing at speed, I learned to [notice when I was rushing](https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/2020/07/26/my-current-phenomenological-model-of-my-typing-skill/), and slow down to focus on precision, and to notice when things felt smooth, so that [I could push more oomph into it](`https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/2020/07/26/my-current-phenomenological-model-of-my-typing-skill/`). Combined, these created a kind of control system of keeping the "intensity" in line with my structure, without getting ahead of myself, or rushing. [note that that isn't exactly what the first link describes, though it does match my memory]
- **Juggling** - Noticing the balls deviating somewhat from that pattern, and focusing on making "adjustments" that to bring the pattern back in line. 

####Rapid alteration

Epistemic status

If there are two patterns that you tend to get mixed up, practice with a training regime where you rapidly alternate between them, semi-randomly.

Go as slowly as you need to in order to notice, and concretely decide 

Examples:

* **Spelling** - If I tend to mess up which words are spelled with an "ie" and which words are spelled with an "ei", (ie "pieces" and "recieve"), I'll do a typing / spelling practice session, in which only or mostly includes words with those two patterns, so that I have to pay attention to which is needed for each word, and build the more neuanced skill of typing the right pattern in the right context, instead of building the habit of always typing ie, and then overiding that habit with always typing ei, and generally getting muddled. 


####Identify earlier and more subtle gradients / feedback mechanisms; make smaller earlier corrections

Epistemic status:


- Juggling: I could tell when I missed a catch or dropped a ball, but by that point it was already too late to do a correction, and the pattern would collapse. But I noticed that I would catch the ball with different parts of my hand, sometimes between my fingers, sometimes on the ridge between my thumb and forefinger, sometimes on my palm. When I caught the ball with my fingers, I would typically loose control of the pattern a few steps latter. But, this was early enough that I could do the correction: making sure to catch with my palm on the next iteration. 

####Do a smaller thing, with greater ease-ness

If the exercise that I've selected for myself feels frustrating, then it isn't the right exercise yet.


####What you can't control, just predict



Juggling - If I'm trying to throw a ball up in the air and hit a target (or my foot, since then I have immediate feedback without needing to look), and I'm finding that this is really hard, I can start by throwing the ball at the target, and trying to predict, after it leaves my hand, but before it lands, if the ball will hit the target. Oftentimes I will be able to feel that a throw was "good" or "off", which attunes me to that feedback mechanism. And sometimes, I'll be *surprised*, I expect a throw to land, and it doesn't, or vis versa, which allows me to refine my feeling of what "good" feels like.

####Slow down / rushing doesn't pay


####Use a more sensitive instrument

Epistemic status: 

Find a version of the task or exercise that accentuates or amplifies your errors. This gives you stronger feedback on small errors and forces you to decrease your margin of error.

Examples:

- Juggling - Use lighter balls, which are harder to control, because they will deviate more from their trajectories from minute discrepancies in their throws.

####Find proprioceptive one-ness

####Stair-stepping
Epistemic status:

Alternate between a harder version and an easier version of the same exercise

Examples:

- Juggling - Alternate between juggling with easier, heavier balls, and harder, lighter balls.


####Do it again


####Intense focus without tension






###Study Heuristics and Strategies

The point of reading is *to have new thoughts*.

####Rereading and overpowered

An idea from Winifred (h/t Rafe):

* Read the texbook on day 1
* Put the theroms into Anki on day 2
* Read the textbook in depth on day 3


###Active Learning 


####Paraphrasing / summarizing

- To my self
- To a partner
- To a tutor


####Visual/ Kinesthetic Metaphors




- "Why does this matter?"
- "How could I practice this?"
- "How would I use this?"
- "What's an example of this in my own life?"


###Do it again

####Incremental reading

Always always change _something_. I don't allow myself to move on from a block until I have added something new, either a question, or a compression, or at least a note. If I have nothing whatsoever to change, then I remove the "#IR" tag.




#####Posing open ended questions

The answers can then be trimmed down to be the answers to anki cards.

**An outline of core skills**

- Learning
    - Embracing embarrassment
    - Not rushing
    - How to be engaged
    - Chunking to size 
        - (is this the same core idea as deliberate practice?)

    - Tutoring
    - Mnemonic principles
    - Spaced Repetition


Chunking to size
    
If something feels to hard or ownerous, such that I'm bouncing off of it, that means that I'm trying to take too big a chunk at once, and I need to break it down into simpler components. 

In general, the proximal next step should always feel tractable. If it isn't, I'm trying to do too big of a chunk at once.





* Alegebra - I'm trying to deeply understand how and why the quadratic formula works. This depends on completing the square. So I don't feel solid about what "completing the square" is or why it works, I'll back up, leaving the quadratic formula for now, and make my new goal just understand completing the square deeply. (Conceretely, I'll make a math chunk roam page for "completing the square" and put it in spaced repetition.) After solidifying my understanding of completing the square, by playing with the idea and probably doing some cycles of khan accademy exercises in spaced repetetion, do I go back to the quadratic formula.


As I learn math, I'm traversing up and down a tree of simpler and more complicated componenents: I start with something that I want to learn, and then as I feel overwhelmend, I pull out simpler chunks that don't feel solid to me, and focus on those. I do this recursively, until I get down to some layer where each component piece is simple enough and I understand it well enough, that I can combine them into something new that fits together in a gearsy way, that I actually have understanding of why this has to be the case, instead of a flailing feeling of making guesses or memorizing arbitrary symbol strings. Then I build back up 






###How I learn math


* If a card ever feels onerous or [ughy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields), that's a sign that it is two large, and I need to break it down into smaller, more manageable / trackable feeling chunks. (This is important, because otherwise, I'm apt to churn through all of the cards that I feel the affordance to make progress on, and then be left with a deck filled with cards that feel annoying and frustrating, and then I will develop an ugh field around doing a learning chunk review at all.)
* Or get tutoring


* Prioritize which material has good explainations.

* I made it low friction to schedule tutoring
