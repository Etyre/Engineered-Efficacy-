#State and energy modulation 

##Rhythms

###Core principle: Increase amplitude 

The key principle is that I want to increase the amplitude of my energy and focus. I either want to be amping up, pushing myself, being fast or focused, or I want to be explicitly and efficiently resting. I want to avoid the middling states where I’m working, but not very intently, or not working, but mostly in a distracted not-enormously restful way. Focused, high intensity period are high value, and high quality rest supports the “on” states, but the middle range is not very effective.

###Week-level macro structure


###Day level structure: up time and downtime

The biggest structural detail that supports increasing amplitude is that I live on a biphasic schedule. I have two focused, “up time” work blocks, one in the morning and the evening, separated by a scheduled period in the middle, that is blocked out (so that people can’t make meetings with me) to slow down and rest.

####Down time / rest blocks

The downtime block is 2 or 3 hours long, from 3:00 PM to about 5:30 PM, on my late schedule, or from 11:00 AM to about 1:30 PM, when I’m on an extra early schedule.

The ideal is that I’ll nap, and fall asleep, in this block. But that’s not strictly necessary. I might just lie down with my eyes closed for 20 minutes or so.
Typically, I’ll eat my meal for the day in this block, and then lay down to nap immediately afterwards, while my body is transitioning into parasympathetic activation. (And depending on what I just ate, my blood sugar spikes, crashing my subjective energy).

####Up time / go blocks

Generally, I’ll do tasks / meetings / work that is accelerated by a high APM in the morning block, and then do deep work (writing, programming, studying), in the evening block. But those are general trends, and I could schedule any kind of work that I need to for each block.

There’s a micro amplitude structure within these blocks of time, where I’m either pushing myself to go as hard as I can, or explicitly resting by lying down with my eyes closed. Basically, at any given point, if I feel tired or sluggish or out of it, I have a choice: I either amp up, or explicitly cool down and relax.
 
#####Amping up:

If I’m not feeling energized by default, I’ll use one of a few techniques to raise my energy, and more importantly, my tempo. Low energy can be compensated for by heightened arousal or momentum.

#####“Breaks are not for stimulation”

It is tempting, when I’m attention is flagging and my brain is tried, to watch some snippets of TV, or to read web comics. These are stimulating, or interesting.

But just because they’re appealing doesn’t mean that they’re effective rest activities. They’re typically less re-energizing than non-stimulating activities.
And more importantly, they’re attentional hooks. Especially when I’m drained, I’m apt to get absorbed in the short term feedback loops of that kind of stimulation and drop my intentionality.

I have a mantra “breaks are not for stimulation.”

I do need to rest my mind in between bouts of intense work, I’m aiming to __rest__, to be entertained.

Typically, for my first break of the day, I’ll go strength train. (Which entails amping up, but is a way to rest my mind), and for most other breaks, just lie down with my eyes closed.

#####Structure:

In these periods, I want to keep my intentionality crisp and taught: I’m being deliberate about what I’m doing with my attention from moment to moment.

The practices described in the other section, keeping a metacognition log a hot key stroke away, and tracking my time with toggl, helps with this.

In addition to those, I provide structure to these blocks by either working with a collaborator (potentially working on a shared project together, or alternatively, coworking on different things), or using my chess timer app.
                - Working with a collaborator: either we’re working on a shared project, and so the social
                - Chess-timer app: I made an app that
            - Rest and free-choice blocks
                - I’m maintaining a high energy amplitude by alternating between intense activation and high quality rest. But across both of these I’m maintaining the tautness of my intention: insisting on a focus and deliberateness of my attention.
                - Most notably, I’m intentionally taking non-stimulating breaks, which entails directing my attention against a natural gradient.
                - This drains a resource on a different dimension. It’s draining to keep up my intentionality: to be continually keeping my attention on track.
                - My experience is that I can typically keep this up for a few days before it starts to decay.
                - So every 5th “up” block (half of every third day) is a rest and free choice time, in which I can do whatever I want. That might be watching TV, or masturbating, or reading a book, or going for a walk, or socializing.
                - This cadence: one half of every third day, is experimental. Maybe I’ll settle on having to do this more or less frequently.
                - But I chose that cadence so that there’s always a free-choice block coming up relatively soon. This is intentionally an outlet policy. If I feel tempted to let go and watch a TV show for instance, I want to be be able to credibly think to myself “I can do that during my next free-choice block”, which is never more than 3 days away.
                - The idea is that I am more willing to push myself to keep my intentionality high, knowing that I’m not asking myself to deny myself those things. I’m just asking myself to wait until (for instance) Thursday.
