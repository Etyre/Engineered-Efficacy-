###Fermi estimates

#### Tactics

##### Exchange rates

When trying to do end-to-end expected value estimates and comparisons, I need to know how to evaluate unlike units.

A quick and dirty way to do this is to assign best guess exchange rates between them. For what value of X would I be indifferent between X baubles and one batter?

For instance, thinking about researcher output is confusing, because researchers are not all created equal. A dominating fact of my life and my world is that there's a power law in how valuable their work is. 

So projects that take aim at producing more effective researcher-hours depend heavily on the specific researchers in question. And of course, part of the problem is that no one really knows if *anyone's* work is useful, much less who's work is good.

But just like with everything in this domain, we're better off trying to reason with, and constrain our uncertainty with, our shitty best guess numbers than throwing up our hands and acting as if everything is equal.

So the thing that I might do (have done, in fact), is start with one researcher that I know relatively well, and who's work I relatively respect, and declare him to be the unit researcher. 

Then, I loop through all the other researchers and do a rough comparison to the unit researcher. Suppose that somehow near-clones of existing researchers were being added to the world. For how many marginal copies of the unit researchers, would I feel indifferent between that and one more marginal unit researcher? That factor is the exchange rate between a specific researcher and the unit-researcher. If I do this comparison for each researcher, it gives me a rough and dirty gut-estimate that I can use for valuing research hours between different researchers in other calculations.

(The factor might be greater than, equal to, or less than 1, but it shouldn't be negative.)
