# Energy and Intentionality modulation 

## Energetic Rhythms

### Core principle: Increase amplitude 

The key principle to my life rhythms is that I want to increase the *amplitude* of my energy and focus. 

I either want to be amping up, pushing myself, being fast or focused, or I want to be explicitly and efficiently resting. I want to avoid the middling states where I’m working, but not very intently, or not working, but mostly in a distracted not-particularly restful way. Focused, high intensity periods are high value, and high quality rest supports the “on” states, but the middle range is not very effective.

### Day level structure: Up time and Down time

The biggest structural detail that supports increasing amplitude is that I live on a biphasic schedule. I have two focused “up time” work blocks every day, one in the morning and the evening, separated by a period in the middle, that is blocked out (so that people can’t make meetings with me) to slow down and rest.

#### Down time / rest blocks

The downtime block is 2 or 3 hours long, from 3:00 PM to about 5:30 PM, ussually, or from 11:00 AM to about 1:30 PM, when I’m on an extra early schedule.

The ideal is that I’ll nap, and fall asleep, in this block. But that’s not *necessary*. I might just lie down with my eyes closed for 20 minutes or so.

See my [napping protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctnO9pwF7Ti7AjyYGoSiiTzAHidUZn-mZ4EvwHqPl9M/edit) for more detail.

Typically, I’ll eat my meal for the day in this block, and then lay down to nap immediately afterwards, while my body is transitioning into parasympathetic activation. (And depending on what I just ate, my blood sugar spikes, crashing my subjective energy).

#### Up time / go blocks

##### Intentionality Timers

For up periods in which I'm doing independent work, instead of taking meetings or doing tasks in rapid i/o with the world, I'll set an "intentionality timer".

I'll set a timer for (usually) a 2 to 4 hour block. For the length of the timer, I don't let my intentionality go lax. I'm maintaining an "executing intensions" mindset, I might switch what I'm doing in this block, but whatever I'm doing, I deliberately choose to switch my intention. 

For the length of this period, I maintaining an alert, high-arousal, "[taut](https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2020/02/10/modes-not-traits-and-decoupling-cognitive-energy-from-intentionality/)" mode. 

In support of that, I track my time with toggl, and also frequently explicate my second-to-second thought process in a metacognition log. In particular, whenever I finish a task, or decide to take a break, I'll flip to my metcognition log (via the custom hotkey) to take stock and then deliberately decide what to do next.

```
TAP: [Task finalization moment] -> 
	Flip to metacog log
```
If I feel the need to take a break, I'll typically assess what I'm doing next, and load it up a bit in my mind, *first*, to smooth the process of coming back to work.

If I notice that I've gotten distracted from my intention during an intentionality block, I immediately log my distraction in my metacognition log, and then go back to the thing that I was doing.

For these blocks, I need to be fully dressed (casual clothes like pajamas, bathrobe, or sweatpants don't count). It might be correlational, but my impression is that I don't achieve the desired intentness when I'm not dressed yet.

I also have to sit or stand at a desk, rather than sitting in on my floor chair. 

These are small nudges towards alertness and intentionality.

I also quit slack before I start an intentionality block. I have good conversations on some of the slacks that I'm a part of—responding there leads to productive thinking and writing. But I want to save that kind of reactive thinking and writing for outside of intentionality blocks.

I'll also make a point to maintain good posture during these periods.

```
TAP: Notice that I'm slumping -> 
	Sit up straight
```

Generally, I’ll do tasks / meetings / work that is accelerated by a high APM in the morning block, and then do deep work (writing, programming, studying), in the evening block. But those are general trends, and I could schedule any kind of work that I need to for each block.

There’s a smaller structure within these blocks of time, where I’m either pushing myself to go as hard as I can, or explicitly resting by lying down with my eyes closed. Basically, at any given point, if I feel tired or sluggish or out of it, I have a choice: I either amp up, or explicitly cool down and relax.

If, before I start an intentionality timer, I feel hesitant about committing to an intentionality block, I'll shorten the length of time, instead of reducing the intensity. I want to be practicing alert intenseness. If I don't feel up for a full 4 hours, I'll reduce the length of the block (before I start!) until I feel confident about committing to deliberate intentionality for that period.

Motivation comes from momentum. My goal is to build momentum every day. 
 
##### Amping up:

At the start of a taut block, or if at any point I my energy is flagging, I’ll use one of a few techniques to raise my energy, and more importantly, my tempo. Low energy can be compensated for by heightened arousal or momentum.

[note: possibly I should just always do Resonance Frequency Breathing instead?]

Namely...

* Breath of fire / bellows breathing
* "Energizing" breathing (hyperventilating for through my nose for 20 breaths followed by a 20 second breath hold at the end of an exhale)
* Doing 90 seconds of cardio
* Power walking to raise my tempo
* "Overreacting" to raise my tempo

Relatedly, I've trained myself to wakeup from sleep and naps instantly, and then immediately move into momentum.

##### Intentional rest: “Breaks are not for stimulation”

It is tempting, when I’m attention is flagging and my brain is tried, to watch some snippets of TV, or to read web comics, or look at memes online. These are stimulating, or interesting.

But just because they’re appealing doesn’t mean that they’re effective rest activities. They’re typically less re-energizing than non-stimulating activities.

And more importantly, they’re attentional hooks. Especially when I’m drained, I’m apt to get absorbed in the short term feedback loops of that kind of stimulation and drop my intentionality.

(I used to have a TAP that when I would flip to a video site, I would immediately flip to my metacogniton log, and note the distraction, but that's obviated by the fact that I've blocked all the media elements on my main computer. I have to [walk a few blocks](https://wild-quit-ebe.notion.site/Passive-consumption-and-addiction-distraction-policies-e9467e7d3d2b479a8847f2da6c70063d) to my friends' house to watch video content.)

I have a mantra “breaks are not for stimulation.”

I do need to rest my mind in between bouts of intense work, I’m aiming to *rest*, not to be entertained.

So if I feel like I need to take a break, I'll lie down with my eyes closed, listening to pink noise, until I feel motivated to get up and make progress again.

##### Food

A crucial piece of maintaining energy and tautness is that I don't eat at all during intentionality blocks, with the exception of a liquid meal / protein shake following a workout. Eating spikes-and-crashes my blood sugar and lowers my energy.

If I'm hungry or have a generic, non-hunger, interest in eating, I'll drink a container of water or a cup of tea, or I'll chew gum (I prefer the [simply brand](https://www.simplygum.com/collections/gum)) instead.

```
TAP: Feel a vague pull to eat ->
	Snap, put my attention mentally on gum-boxes
```


```
TAP: Finish eating a meal, tempted to eat more ->
	Put my attention mentally on gum-boxes	
```
Eating causes my energy to dip or crash (though by how much depends on what I eat). So I'm careful to time it. I don't let myself eat casually. **** 

##### Physical Speed

In uptime, I make a point to physically move fast. If I need go somewhere that is more than a 15 minute walk away, I'll take an uber. If the location is closer than that, I'll run there, never walk.

<!--#####Structure:

In these periods, I want to keep my intentionality crisp and taught: I’m being deliberate about what I’m doing with my attention from moment to moment.

The practices described in the other section, keeping a metacognition log a hotkeystroke away, and tracking my time with toggl, helps with this.

In addition to those, I provide structure to these blocks by either working with a collaborator (potentially working on a shared project together, or alternatively, coworking on different things), or using my chess timer app.

#####Rest and free-choice blocks

I’m maintaining a high energy amplitude by alternating between intense activation and high quality rest. But across both of these I’m maintaining the tautness of my intention: insisting on a focus and deliberateness of my attention.

Most notably, I’m intentionally taking non-stimulating breaks, which entails directing my attention against a natural gradient.

This drains a resource on a different dimension. It’s draining to keep up my intentionality: to be continually keeping my attention on track.

My experience is that I can typically keep this up for a few days before it starts to decay.

So every 5th “up” block (half of every third day) is a rest and free choice time, in which I can do whatever I want. That might be watching TV, or masturbating, or reading a book, or going for a walk, or socializing.

This cadence: one half of every third day, is experimental. Maybe I’ll settle on having to do this more or less frequently.

But I chose that cadence so that there’s always a free-choice block coming up relatively soon. This is intentionally an outlet policy. If I feel tempted to let go and watch a TV show for instance, I want to be be able to credibly think to myself “I can do that during my next free-choice block”, which is never more than 3 days away.

The idea is that I am more willing to push myself to keep my intentionality high, knowing that I’m not asking myself to deny myself those things. I’m just asking myself to wait until (for instance) Thursday.-->

#### Non-intentionality block up-time

Sometimes I'm doing work where my attention is not directed primarily by my internal executive process, but rather by my environment. This includes when I'm doing operations, when I'm running a workshop, when I'm taking meetings, or working on single projects with urgent environmental deadlines.

For these kinds of work periods, I don't make a point to maintain the tautness of my intention, though I maintain many of the same practices, somewhat less strictly. Mainly I just focus on doing things fast: when I have a next task, I aim to do it immediately. I allow my meeting schedule or the ongoing events in my environment to shape my moment to moment priorities, and when I have an un-directed moment, I refer back to my todo list and make progress on the most urgent task * the task that I have the most [ambiguity aversion](https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2019/03/17/committed-engagement-and-the-critical-importance-of-ambiguity/) about.

### Week-level macro structure: 

I currently take rest and free-choice time twice a week: all day on Sunday, and in the second half of the day on Wednesday. This is time that I've cleared for myself to do whatever seems appealing, from masturbating (ideally with my full attention to making the experience good, instead of as a furtive diversions), to reading, to study, to strength training.

The point is for this to be frequent enough that I always have an upcoming free-choice block, so that whenever I'm tempted by some distraction I can remind myself that I'm not saying "no" to it, full stop, I'm deferring it by a few days at most. I'll make a note of the distraction to come back and review on Sunday / Wednesday.

I find that when I make space in which I allow myself to do whatever I want, in contrast to thinking that I "should" be doing something, but procrastinating, I'll often do do pretty rewarding stuff. 

### Stimulant usage

I use stimulant to boost my highest quality work hours, not to compensate for otherwise low energy / low focus states.

For more detail see my [Stimulant policy](https://wild-quit-ebe.notion.site/Stimulant-and-supplement-policy-ceaa8d7318fa4cea858c2998ade63127).

### Appendix: State modulation TAPs

[To be completed]

## Emotional Processing

The most important factor for my personal energy and intentionality is being emotionally-energetically unblocked / unstuck.

### Physiology

*Sometimes* my low energy is strictly physiological.

Any time I feel low energy or unmotivated, I first check if I've been exercising recently, if not, I make a point to exercise, and especially to do weighted squats, before anything else.

If I'm feeling low energy in a way related to being sleep deprived, or tired, I'll intentionally raise my arousal for an up period, and then intentionally lower it and take a long nap, as described below.

### Psychology

But aside from that, if I'm feeling low energy or uninterested in work or otherwise unenthusiastic about getting up and making progress, I'll explicitly make space to listen to any parts of me that might be sad or scared or hurting or stuck.

I'll sit down, possibly starting by reducing my arousal with regular breathing techniques, and explicitly dialog with whatever parts of me are needing something, and reaffirm my commitment to serving them, serving all my goals and values, as best I can.

See my [Focusing Moves](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXqflthzbr65CjYYK68wTzLlA6Dc96_qazr_KzOCYLg/edit#heading=h.1yj993x90dbb) document, for some of my more specific procedures.

Almost always, if I'm feeling low energy or unmotivated or unfocused, it's because [something that I care about is unhandled](https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2023/11/05/very-low-energy-states-seem-to-contain-compressed-fear-or-despair/). 

In the easy cases, I'll do Focusing, surface the priority of mine I hadn't been tracking consciously, and make a plan that attends to that (now conscious) priority. It's a simple handoff of goal-relevant info between a non-conscious part of me to the conscious deliberate planning processes.

In the harder cases, there will be a problem that feels stuck and intractable or a [motivational knot](https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/2020/08/14/motivational-knots/), multiple goal-threads in tension, pulling against each other. Typically, that double bind is painful and I'm dulling or numbing or distracting myself from it, one consequence of which is my overall feeling of low energy or unmotivation. That might be expressing itself as depression. Or alternatively, it might manifest as or as anxiety / agitation with an inability to focus on much of substance, my attention flitting from distraction to distraction. 

Unsurprisingly, especially to the extent that the problem or tension seems intractable, I'm apt to develop a strong aversions / [ugh field](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields) around engaging with it. I don't have a solution to this except recommitting to serving all my values, having faith in my own problem-solving ability, and starting at the top of the stack, by dialoging with the avoidant part and building [lines of retreat](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3XgYbghWruBMrPTAL/leave-a-line-of-retreat) as I go. I wish I had a much more robust solution, it seems like that would be transformative for me.

[Maybe the thing that I should be doing here is core transformation, to better get to the root, of the things that are in tension? And over time, my system would learn to trust that these tensions are resolvable?]

Friends, who can gently hold space, having compassion for me and all the parts of me, can make this easier.


#### An aside on localized aversion


(Sometimes I'll feel unmotivated about a particular task that I've set for myself, shying away from it or procrastinating on it or bouncing off of it, but otherwise feeling alive and active. This is a notably different phenomenon from generalized low energy.

Usually this is the result of an [ambiguity aversion](https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2019/03/17/committed-engagement-and-the-critical-importance-of-ambiguity/), and I need to do the GTD practice of clarifying a next action, or stating explicitly what uncertainty I'm bouncing off of. 

Sometimes the task will just doesn't seem worthwhile, in which case I'll IDC, or Goal-Factor, or make a quantitative EV estimate (which I find is often very effective for getting my visceral motivation and my "should"s on the same page), or do [goal-chain inspection](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/C74TQRgvieB8yNDst/toon-alfrink-s-sketchpad?commentId=pN8yb29xpuHDyyjqx), which technique depending on the flavor of my unmotivation and my sense that the task is worth doing anyway.)
                
## Resourcing

There are a bunch of basic health and fitness things that support my energy, and I've built systems to make sure that those are well attended to as a matter of course.

### Sleep

The single most important thing for maintaining my energy and intentionality is systematically getting enough sleep.

See my [sleep process and policies](https://wild-quit-ebe.notion.site/Sleep-process-and-policies-6f7a204833a34d4b99ad44860258ca7c), for more.

#### Napping

As noted above, I nap most days.

See my [napping protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctnO9pwF7Ti7AjyYGoSiiTzAHidUZn-mZ4EvwHqPl9M/edit).

### Hydration

I keep a box of containers of water next to my desk at home and next to my desk in my office. When I take my supplements first thing in the morning, I'll also drink a full bottle of water.

Additionally, the color (and odor) of my urin is a lagging indicator of a control system for staying hydrated. If I see my my pee is dark yellow, I'll ask myself, out loud, where the nearest place to get water is, and then immediately go get some.

```
TAP: See that my pee is dark yellow -> 
	Ask, out loud, where's the easiest place to get water.
```

### Exercise

I strength train most days. Generally, If I exercised yesterday, I'll only do one exercise. If I didn't exercise yesterday, I'll do two.

It helps a lot that I have a gym accessible from my office, so that I can work out as a work break in my taut-blocks.

For more detail see my [exercise policy](https://wild-quit-ebe.notion.site/Exercise-policy-458a9d81c91e46e6b8c7fdcae25b7621). 


### Diet
