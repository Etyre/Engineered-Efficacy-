### üî≤ Building understanding 

 Rapid orienting and getting a high level view

??Start by breaking down very basic fundamental questions??

"And you‚Äôll have a semantic mental ‚Äòframework‚Äô in your brain on which to  then hang all the great things you learn from your reading, which makes  it more likely that you‚Äôll retain that stuff as well. I read somewhere  that Bill Gates structures his famous ‚Äúreading weeks‚Äù around an outline  of important questions he‚Äôs thought about and broken down into pieces.  e.g. he‚Äôll think about ‚Äúwater scarcity‚Äù and then break it down into  questions like ‚Äúhow much water is there in the world?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere does  existing drinking water come from?‚Äù, ‚Äúhow do you turn ocean water into  drinking water‚Äù, etc., and only *then* will he pick reading to address those questions. "

When in need of a conversation topic, ask a question about the other person's life. Anything about their life. (If I can't think of something else, I ask about weekend plans.) Listen for what part of their answer they're most interested in. Ask followup questions about that thing. Repeat as necessary.

People like to talk about themselves. This cuts awkward silences down to nothing and makes people like you. I've also learned all sorts of fascinating things about my acquaintances.
