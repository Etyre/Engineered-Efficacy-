This was process I tried for a while to make transitioning out of less effective states easier, by reducing the cognitive overhead. I would basically answer a series of questions to navigate a tree of possible states, and then the app would tell me directly what to do next, instead of my needing to diagnose what was up with me free-form, and then figure out how to respond to that, all of which was unaffordable when I was in a low efficacy state.
