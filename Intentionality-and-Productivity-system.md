#Productivity and Intentionality outline

[note to myself: just describe what I do. I can go back and include sections on the general theory later.]


My productivity and intentionality system has 3 steps: 

Maximize my personal energy
Increase my intentionality 
Do the right thing

I have a bunch of behaviors, habits, and processes, which serve each of those goals. 

There’s some overlap between them: intentionality depends on personal energy, so interventions that increase energy tend to increase intentionality too, and it’s often a judgment call whether to frame a behavior as increasing intentionality, or as focusing my attention on a specific task. 

##Maximize Energy

###Sleep

Getting a good night’s sleep is the single most important thing for boosting my personal energy.

###Exercise

Second to good sleep, Exercise is, as near as I can tell, the most important thing to optimize for my personal energy. I exercise almost every day as part of my set of “daily things”. 

In general, I follow this rule: the optimal form of exercise is whichever one you will actually do. 

There are two main things that I do for exercise are barbell training (squats, deadlifts, bench presses, shoulder presses, bent over rows) and beatsaber, with weights on my wrist.

My wellbeing seems to be disproportionately impacted by [doing weighted squats](https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/2020/11/08/squats-made-a-big-difference/), in particular.

###Energetic rhythms

Sleep and exercise are, on the scale of days and weeks, general boosters to my personal energy. I do them, and I have higher energy as a result.

Beyond those two however, increasing my personal energy is largely a matter of being attuned too, and working with (instead of against), various physiological / psychological rhythms. For many behaviors, it isn't the behavior in of itself that matters, but the _timing_, of the behavior. 

In general, I am aiming to increase my energetic _[amplitude](https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1389213303331823616?s=20)_, magnifying whichever way my energy is currently trending.

In my life, there are increasing marginal returns to focus, alertness, and engagement. With a few exceptions, if something is worth doing at all, it benefits strongly from my fullest, most resourced effort. For most tasks, a half-focused version is not even worth doing.

For instance, when I'm too tired to work, I might slide into reading articles that I've saved up. But for any given article, it's either worth giving it full attention: good posture, taking notes, putting my notes into a review system, or it isn't. But if it isn't worth actually paying attention to, so that I have new thoughts or remember the content, then it isn't worth reading at all.

So when I’m cognitively drained, or otherwise low energy, instead of continuing to try to eke out some dregs of work, I switch gears and focus on _resting as effectively as possible_. 

####On the scale of a day

When I’m cognitively drained, or otherwise low energy, instead of continuing to try to eke out some dregs of work, I switch gears and focus on resting as effectively as possible. 

#####Yoga Nidra

The biggest contributor to intentional rest is doing yoga nidra: when I feel tired, I’ll lie down and employ a process to relax both my body and my mind. A good portion of the time (50%?) I’ll fall asleep and take a nap. But regardless, I’ll usually feel alert and energized after 20 to 90 minutes, and I get up and keep moving. This has been a game-changer for me. Instead of wasting hours with random distractions on the internet while I’m too tired to do any substantive work, I can deliberately rest, and come back refreshed, instead.

#####Daily structure

I live on a classic siesta schedule.  Generally, I structure my days to have two main work blocks, with a long break in between. Instead of having a work day, and then ending the work day and relaxing, I relax in the middle of the day, and then after recouping energy, go back to work.

This has the benefit of aligning with my circadian dip, so that my rest time overlaps with (better word?) the part of my day when my energy is lowest due to circadian effects, and I leverage / take advantage of the high energy and alertness due to the alerting signal. (If i’m not drained, these late hours are often my most productive and effective.)

Secondly, this effectively gives me two work days, which is helpful for re-setting context. I’ll often do external-value creation work in the morning, and learning projects (ie internal value creation) in the evenings.

Paul Graham reports that he [lived on a similar schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) when working on ViaWeb.

The timing of my break is flexible: depending on when I finish the first work block and when I feel ready to start the second (though I will often have some TAP chain for booting up into my second workblock), but it usually takes place somewhere in the span from 5 pm to around 9 pm. I’ll nap or do yoga, nidra if need it. This is when I eat my main meal, and I’ll sometimes take social time in here as well. Usually, I’ll hang out and talk with colleagues at the office, or whoever is around Event Horizon (a group house a few blocks from my room). If I had a partner, or someone I was casually dating, I would probably hang out with them around this time.

####On the scale of days 

On the scale of days, I’m aiming to stay attuned to my energetic rhythms. I used to push myself hard until I crashed, and my intentionality collapsed. There’s a bit of an art to noticing when I’m just starting to run on fumes, so that I can take a slower day to refresh myself, without losing my intentionality entirely.

#####Rest days 

I also take a rest day at least once a week, in which I do what is most nourishing. Mostly that means slowing down, taking time making food, catching up on meditation and exercise as needed, reading, writing essays, and working on whatever learning projects feels most appealing in (mostly) one hour chunks. On rest days, I use a special computer that has everything blocked except Roam (which is where I take notes on books, and is also my journal), and google sheets/docs/forms which is where most of my personal tracking lives. The idea is to take a break from the compulsive dopamine loops of the internet, while still being able to take notes that will be searchable later.

##Increase intentionality 

###Inline logging and written meta-cognition

I have a section in my daily roam pages called “daily log”, that I come back to many times a day to jot down notes about what’s happening, and, as necessary, figure out what I should do about it.

This typically includes... 

**Phenomenology that I notice**, such as aversions, flinches, agitation, heat in my chest, clenches in my belly. Noticing these, I can turn my attention to them directly, doing Focusing, or otherwise dialoguing with them.

**Bugs** - Things that just went wrong, or points of friction. Sometimes I’ll solve these on the spot, other times I’ll just make a note of what went wrong to solve in a dedicated debugging session later.

Some examples of bugs
- My nap was interrupted because my phone rang
- I couldn’t sync my phone, because I didn’t have a USB to USB-C adaptor [buy 3 on the spot]
- I just said that I would do a thing, which on reflection, I probably don’t want to do.

**Decisions** - I’ll note decisions that I have to make and then work them out in writing, asking what the considerations and the cruxes are. 

Writing things out concretizes things. It helps me to notice fleeting or amorphous feelings and inclinations, so that I can fully engage with them. A vague sense of aversion that I only barely notice, will control my behavior, but once I write out “I’m feeling a slight sense of aversion to X”, I can, then ask the next question of “what’s bad about X?” 

Most often, once I make the shift to attending to it directly, I can just feel the underlying psychological structure directly: I can tell exactly what is bad about X, and figure out how to orient to that, without needing to play the guess-and-check game of traditional focusing. 

But, this is only if I notice it and respond to the subtle experience consciously. So I want to do everything that I can to make it as low friction as possible to go from “some part of me is partially conscious of something” [can I be more specific about what “something” is] to “I’ve written it down, and thereby have flagged it for myself 

So I want to have a habit of coming back to that log and noting what’s happening frequently.

This is especially important because many of the things that I most want to notice tend to decrease how much consciousness I have available. If I’m agitated or anxious, my attention is likely trying to dissociate or distract myself to flee some pain. And I do not want to brute force stop that dissociation or distraction, but I do want to notice it and stay with ti.

This sort of work is just too slippery to do only in my head.
Fastidious Time tracking


###Meditate

Currently, I meditate for a minimum of 10 minutes every day. 

In principle, this seems like it should boost a sort of generalized resource of consciousness or reflectiveness or non-reactiveness, though I waffle on how much it actually helps.

My favorite kind of meditation is See, Hear, Feel mediation, where I note, out loud, visual imagery, verbal content, and body sensations, with the words "See", "Hear", "Feel", respectively, while "greeting" and then absorbing myself in each one.

But I'll sometimes mix it up with a simple mediation of returning to my breath, or noting when a sensation as passed away, or noting when my thoughts are of the "future" or the "past".

My goal with meditation is to find my way into the right kind of expansive state, where I am sensitive to everything happening inside of me, but not reacting to it.

###Wake up all at once

How I wake up seems to make a big difference for my intentionality. Basically, it is a big boost if I have directed intentionality from the get-go, from the moment I wake up, instead of booting up gradually over the course of an hour or two.


###Agitation and Aversion

[This feels like a big one that I'll have to untangle.]

In my experience, aversions are by far the dominating factor in my personal productivity. When I don't have any aversions, I can pretty easily get into a state of clipping rapidly through tasks, flowing from one thing to another, for hours at a time. Life feels smooth, and action is efficient. But if I have even one aversion, to something that I think I should do, in the mix, it acts as a sort of speed bump, slowing everything down, as I take (rationalized) actions that divert me from the aversive stimulus, instead of moving getting things done as efficiently and effectively as possible.

An aversion is any

But aversion itself is a broad category. There are a number of phenomena that result in aversion-behvior, each of which have distinct structure and underlying mechanisms.





- Motivational knots
- Raw hedonics
- Ambiguity aversion
- Raw agitation




####When I feel agitated, feel into my body

When I feel agitated, I note this in my log, and just stay with the sensation. Just staying with it might cause the feeling to decrease, or it might not, and there might be additional steps, like doing Focusing, or going to exercise to vent the energy. But first and foremost, I log it, and stay with the sensation.

###Lying down in response to stimulation hunger


[I think that this one maybe goes somewhere else.]




##Do the right thing

###Choosing what to do

The most important, and most neglected component of personal productivity is choosing what to work on.

Productivity, is ultimately not about how much you work, or even how much you get done, but how much *value* you create.

	Productivity = Time spent working * efficiency of work * Value of work

It is often much more attractive or compelling to try to find ways to do more, to waste less time, to be more efficient. And certainly, there is value to that. But ultimately that is not the part of the equation that has the most leverage. 




There is a hard limit to how efficient a person can be. At the theoretical maximum they could be working literally every moment of a 24 hour day. 

But, in actual fact, some humans are 10x or 100x or 1000x more productive than the average smart person. 


Jeff Bezos and [hardworking startup person] can both 


It is crucial, more important than anything else here, to work on the right things.



The majority of my work is projects that (hopefully) will increase the probability that humanity will make it through this century. Every couple of weeks, I sit down and ask myself “what is the thing that I could do now, in [the Summer of 2021], that would most increase our chances of things going well in the endgame?” or “Suppose that all my needs were met, and I was personally responsible for seeing the world to safety, what needs to happen?” or some other variation on the same theme.



Some heuristics that I might want to adopt

Just make quantitative estimates of what the highest value thing is to do is, and make writeups to go along with it.

- What might I be able to finish *today*?

###Focus on one thing

I’ve known for years, that context switching was costly, and that the more goals I gave myself to complete in a day, the less likely it is that they will all be be meaningfully loaded up. But nevertheless, I resisted / failed to notice the obvious implication: that I should minimize the number of goals that I take on: focusing on only one thing.


I try to structure as much of my work as I can in focus-days, intense spurts in which I’m pushing hard on accomplishing only a single goal.

This simplification means that I don’t need to decide what to do next: there’s a choice of whether to work or to rest, but not a question of what work I should do; that’s already decided. Batching like this saves me switching costs.

And having one goal means that I can put my all into it. I push as hard as I can to complete that one target, without diverting my energies. Places where I decide what to do next are 

This clarity, and singularity of context makes a noticeable difference in how hard I push myself.

####Shortening time to payoff / cycle time
Additionally, batching like this is sound from an “accounting” perspective. There’s a principle of shortening the time between starting a project and completing it, as much as possible. 

In general, projects require a more-or-less constant contribution of resources, for as long as you are working on them, but you only get the value of the project at the end. 

Let’s say you have 10 projects. If you work on them in sequence, one after the other, you invest your resources in the first one, and then get the payoff of the first one, invest your resources in the second one, and get the payoff from the second project, and so on. While you’re working on the third project, you’ve already reaped the benefits, whatever those may be, of projects 1 and 2

Whereas if you work on those same ten projects in parallel, you are committing resources to all 10 projects, all along, but you aren’t getting the value of those projects for much longer (on average, with some simplifying assumptions 5 times longer). Because you are waiting to realize that value, you can’t use it or reinvest it.

This is true even without accounting for the psychological cost of context switching, or the risk of losing interest and never finishing a project at all.
So I try to do as much work as I can in chunks of one to three days.

Not all of my work is of the form that it can be batched like this however, and I have to use other approaches for other kinds of work.


Digression: 

Generally I think of my work as being of 4 categories. 

1. **Large chunk batchable work and learning**

2. **Spaced learning projects** 

Some learning projects, such as trying to learn almost any physical skill, really benefit from a spacing effect, or from interleaved sleep, such that 5 minutes of focused learning a day is much more effective than several hours once a week. I usually have one such project running at any given time.)

3. **Tasks** 

Processing my email and reminders inbox, making calls, setting appointments, running errands, etc.

These are batchable, and I do often batch them on task days, which are basically focus days where my single goal is “complete this task list", though sometimes the urgency of a task impels me to do it outside of a task day.

4. **Interest-driven reading and writing**

I like to keep some slack in my life, for purely interest-driven reading and writing. 





Kinds of days

Focus day
Rest day
“normal” day
Travel day
Slow day





###Work with environmental structure vs work that depends on internal structure

There's an important dichotomy in kinds of work: whether the structure is internal or external.

Consider running a workshop: participants show up, and there's a schedule. At some point the bell rings, and it is time to teach the next class.

Compare to studying a math textbook. You might have some sort of study schedule, but to a much greater extent, you have the option, at any given moment, to take a break, or to get up and do something else.

Running a workshop has *external structure*. The environment determines your default next action, and broadly directs your attention. 

Studying a math textbook demands *internal structure*: the forces that direct your attention and intention are internal to you.

In general, environmental structure is less contingent, and less fragile / more robust than relying on internal structure. If, at the moment when I need to go "on", during a workshop, I "don't feel like it", I'm almost certainly going to do it anyway, even if it will take an exertion of will. If I "don't feel like" studying, I'm much more likely to slide into distraction. (For better or for worse. Part of the dynamic here is that doing good mathematical study *is* just more sensitive to my energy than teaching a class is, and so it is more likely to be useless if I "don't feel like it".)

This distinction extends beyond merely choosing to work or not to work however. It's also relevant on the micro-level. 

Collaborating side by side with another person on a project is helpful not just because it forces you to show up, but because in any given moment, you can riff off of each other. The engagement with another mind, somehow gives concrete affordances which question to ask, which approach to try next. When you're stuck, instead of staring blankly, there's a natural gradient towards discussing what's happening, and thereby get more traction. 

(I think this is related to why rubber ducking is helpful, and why most people find Focusing easier when then have a Focusing companion to listen to them. I often stimulate this by talking to a recording device, which micro-incentivizes me to vocalize my thought process, which concretizes my thoughts. Indeed, "talking out loud" is so overpowered, that I decided to get my own room, pretty much entirely for the ability to do this.)

Note: talking to myself is one of those things that I don't do nearly enough.

###Creating external structure

In general, if I can convert work that depends on internal structure into work that has its own environmental structure, this is a straightforward boost.

The biggest way to do this is collaborations. I try to do as much of my work as possible as collaborations with other people. 

As Ray Dalio says, two people who work well together are way more than twice as effective as a result of the collaboration.

Relatedly, I think that I should learn some subjects by setting up a recurring session online session with a tutor, and not worrying about that subject at all between sessions. The tutoring sessions provide environmental structure, I just show up at the time, and I learn new subjects automatically.

There's also Focusmate, which is not as good as working with another person, but does provide some environmental structure.

###Getting hooked in

Internal structure is not *always* less reliable than external structure. Sometimes, I'm intrinsically motivated by some task, or there's some puzzle that I'm compulsively trying to make sense of. When I'm in this mode, I'll get up to take a break, and then find myself back at my computer trying a new approach on the problem or writing another paragraph.

The hours fly by, and while the work itself might be draining, there's no exertion involved in keeping my attention on the work.

Generally, 

Being hooked in > relying on external structure > relying on internal structure

So, I try to leverage this by using tricks that help me get hooked in.


###Using a chess-timer

One strategy that I've found to be very helpful is using a chess timer to structure my days. 

I have a simple software app that replicates a chess timer: it has two timers, side by side, each counting down to 0. Only one timer counts down at a time, while the other is paused. Pressing a button switches which is paused and which is running.

One timer counts down my work time, for the day (or a part of the day) while the other timer counts down my break time. Anything that is listed as part of my main goals for the day counts as work, and anything else (including doing my daily things and spaced deliberate practice sessions, unless those are part of my daily goals).

When I pause work to do something else, I switch the timers, and when I come back to work, I switch them back.

I have full flexibility to take a break whenever I want to, however, I don't let my "break" timer run out before my "work" timer.

The only time when I pause *both* timers is when I go to nap, or do yoga nidra. Naps don't count towards the hours of my day.

Generally, I'll allocate 5 hours of work and five hours of break.  

I've found this to be extremely helpful. This practice makes me much more aware of the scarcity of my time and how I am choosing to spend it. It highlights the tradeoffs that are entailed in choosing to distract myself for a bit, or take some time to read an article. 

When I'm not using my chess timer, I might spend 2 hours browsing the internet, or whatever, in a way that *doesn't feel like a cost*. My chess timer is a tool that helps me grock, in the moment, the scarcity of time in the day.

[I'm not that satisfied with the way this section is written up]


###Preplanning, by the clock

Clarifying 

What are the reasons why this is good to do?

- This loads up my goals for the day so that they are at hand.
- This makes my "committing" / deciding to do the thing real, and not epiphenomenal.
- This prevents me from unreflectively adding goals to my day
- This breaks down any ambiguity barriars
	- General principle: unbundling planning and actin
- This allows me to notice any aversions

When I am outlining my main goals, for the next day, I have a rule of spending 3 minutes, by the timer, thinking through what is required for each one, and setting myself up to do it.

That might include... 

- pulling up documents and leaving them open on my desktop, to reduce friction to starting, 
- looking up a phone number that I’ll need
- messaging the person that I’m working with, to confirm our meeting
- Considering what I want to get out of my meeting tomorrow.
- Clarifying a and setting a TAP for starting that task

If nothing else, I will visualize, in detail, what the first steps of the task entail.

There are several interrelated psychological mechanisms that make this so useful. 

1. It makes my "committing" / deciding to do the thing real, and not epiphenomenal.
	- prevents me from unreflectively adding goals to my day
2. It "loads up" my goals for the day
3. This breaks down any ambiguity barriers
	- General principle: unbundling planning and actin
4. This allows me to notice any aversions in advance



####Actually deciding

####Loading up goals

Digression:

General principle: unbundling planning and action

	
####Making space for aversions






The main point is to “load up” my tasks, so that they are at hand, and to break down any ambiguity barriers to starting. 

(What I describe here [link to the relevant section of my musings and rough drafts outline post])


Often time, when people put items on a task list, or say that they are going to do something, that is basically epiphenomenal. Words in the mind that are not connected to the levers of action.

But mental rehearsal is *not* epiphenomenal. Doing some a minimum of three minutes of thinking about the task  /Simulating the task makes it more likely to happen, makes it real. 

And furthermore, it becomes “at hand”. I have a background sense of the things that I want to do for the day. When I get to a choice point in my day, 

Importantly, this is not just a one-way, top down process. Preplanning gives me an opportunity to get signals that I don’t actually want to do this task, or if there is something wrong about how I’m framing it.

- Notice if I have any aversions to the task, flag them and/or start to process them
- Notice if the task doesn’t actually seems worth doing
- Notice if it feels like I’m trying to cram in more than I can realistically do.



For years, even though I knew the principle of motivation, I would regularly make a list of things to do the next day, generating what felt like a full task list, and then remember one other thing that I wanted to do, and give in to the temptation to add it to the list. I’m being casual with my future self, just throwing another thing on his plate, as if it is costless.

Especially when I’m rushing at the end of the day, and am drawing up a task list without much attention or deliberation.

This is bane. 

Adding more things to a list than you are (I am realistically going to do causes the relevant part of my mind to stop taking the list seriously. It isn’t realistically a list of goals any more, 

Drawing up a task list without deliberation, is generally, an epiphenomenal exercise. For the relevant part of my mind to actually adopt these tasks as goals, I have to do the thinking to decide that they are worth the effort. 

But, by having a firm rule that for every item I add, I spend, at minimum, 3 minutes up front thinking about, 1) I just can’t draw up fake lists, or add things to the list casually and 2) I 



Some other ways to load things up include scheduling my day.




I've found this to be absurdly overpowered. Before I started doing this, my records indicate that I would, on average, complete x% of my daily goals. Since I've started doing this, I complete X% of my daily goals on days when I do this, and y% when I don't.


###Social media protections

###My twitter setup
This is the setup that I use for twitter:

I’ve blocked twitter on my phone, and on all my 
I’ve blocked the timeline with NewsFeed eradicator
I’ve set up intention so that I can only visit the twitter site for a total of an hour every day, and so that I have a 30 second wait period, between pre-set chunks.
I’ve set up Roam JS so that I can post twitter threads from my roam (not my main roam database, though since I find it unnerving that I might accidentally post my private journal entries to twitter). 

With these combined software tools, twitter is almost a write-only platform for me. When I have twitter thread shaped thoughts, I can develop them by writing them out in Roam, and posting them without ever needing to visit the extreme attentional hazard of twitter. 

But every couple of days, I will show up to check my notifications, and respond to comments. Sometimes I’ll go read specific people’s pages (@ESYudkowsky, is the main person who comes to mind).

I really do need these protections. Nothing sucks away hours of my life without my even noticing the time passing the way twitter does. And when some part of this system is turned off for some reason, and I have reason to visit twitter, I almost inevitably spend hours casually browsing.

[Note. This is an insult to my dignity as an agent, and I should probably spend some time explicitly practicing disengaging from twitter. But regardless, it is bad practice to rely on personal will to protect yourself from hazards like this one, and I strongly endorse

I have a similar setup for Youtube

suggested videos are blocked with 
Intention prevents me from spending more than an hour a day on both twitter and youtube.

I think that I should experiment with having a dedicated laptop for twitter and youtube (and porn?) and blocking them from my main machine entirely. 

###A the signal of social media

There is something quite useful about social media however, which is that it provides me a very overt error signal.

When I find myself flipping to social media or youtube (or in past years, webcomics), I know

#Outline of Productivity and Intentionality System

##Overview
[I'm going to come back and write the overview last.]

###What this document is

###High Level View of this system

Two broad mutually supportive struts or parts: Being resourced and Habits for guiding my attention. 

###Notes on reading this document

- I'll try to clearly distinguish between specific techniques or strategies that I find helpful (for which one's metaphorical milage may vary) and general underlying principles, which I expect to be relevant across people.

- When I cite academic evidence, I'll note if that evidence is a crux for me or not, and I'll note if the academic evidence 

##Being Resourced

In earlier versions of this model, I mapped out specific psychological states that were necessary for sustaining high output. But I've mostly decided 

- Energy

- Spaciousness / reflectiveness / the opposite of driven-ness

###Sleep

By far the most important behavior for maintaining high energy is sufficient high quality sleep. While I have some tricks for maintaining high focus and momentum even when sleep deprived, the number one most important thing for sustaining high output is to get regular, good sleep. 

[stuff on the benefits of sleep?]

As a sort of propagating urges, I think about sleep as akin to a practice for renewing my connection with the Force (ala star wars). I’m so much crisper and clearer when I am well rested, that it is as if I have a connection to some extra-material energy field, allowing me to be aware of more, think faster, and respond better, and move with deliberateness. 

There are two parts to getting good sleep: strategies for falling asleep quickly and reliably, and ways to improve sleep quality, conditional on falling asleep in the first place.

####Factors for high quality sleep

#####Light and Darkness

I've found that if there is a small amount of sunlight leakage into the room that I'm sleeping in, I’ll spend the whole day slightly groggy.

So if I'm on a schedule where my sleep period overlaps with the sun being up, I make sure to throughly light-insulate my room.

In contrast, I usually walk around the block first thing in the morning (while I brush my teeth), to expose myself to light 

#####Cold

My current posit is that the principle factor for the depth and quality of sleep is my core body temperature during the night. The colder I am, the better I sleep. 

######Ambient temperature

The most straightforward way to cool down my body at night is to sleep in a very cold room, I guess around 65 to 70 degrees ferinheight. (Note: I could actually check with my sleep data from 2020, in which ambient temperature is one of the things that I randomized.)

However, I currently don't have temperature control over the room that I sleep in. I make up for this with a big fan, right behind my head, that blows in the direction of my feet. (Note: It stands to reason that the sound of the fan is hurting my sleep quality. I might want to check this out. If need be, I guess I could get a several of those pink noise fans.) This also helps with airflow and ventilation [see the next section.]

I've also used a chilipad a various points, but I didn't notice that much of a benefit from it. (I might want to reassess this.)

######Physiological hacks

Beyond simply being in a cold place, I think that you can lower your core night-time body temperature by using your body's homeostatic responses.

Four things that I'm experimenting with

- Taking saunas in the evening
- Taking warm showers right before bed
- Taking cold showers right before bed
- Taking alternating warm-cold showers right before bed. 

#####Ventilation and CO2

I'm told that CO2 buildup in the air compromises cognition, and that CO2 build up in the room you're sleeping in can lead to grogginess or low energy during the day.

I haven't tested that myself, but I also crack a window in the room that I sleep in.

######Mouthtaping


#####Ease of peeing

This sounds kind of silly, but I have sometimes find that I sleep badly because I’ll wake up in the middle of the night with a full bladder. I should get up and pee, but because there are a number of steps between me and the bathroom (maybe I need to put on a robe, or navigate around a desk that I can’t see well in the dark), I have an aversion to getting up, and I just stay there in bed and then fall back into an uncomfortable, restless sleep. 

I can circumvent this via future-pacing and rehearsal. I’ll practice, when I’m awake, the steps that I need to take to go pee. Then when I wake up in the middle of the night, that’s the default action.

#####Mattress?

It stands to reason that I would sleep better with a high quality mattress, but I haven't really investigated that yet.

#####Supplements

I currently take [dose] of melatonin shortly before going to bed.

Gwern’s page says it all. [link]

However, Andrew Huberman suggests [link], that I should instead be taking the following: 

####Falling asleep



#####Timing

It's hardly original, but the most important factor for falling asleep is to have a consistent bedtime. 

[maybe insert some stuff about circadian mechanisms]

#####Waking up

The single thing that helps the most (??) with maintaining a consistent sleep time is having a consistent wakeup time.

######Inner wake up call

In the past, I've used an "inner wakeup call" to wake me up at the time of my choosing in the morning. This is a simple process by which I have my body wake me up at the time that I choose.

As I do it, this involves setting intention to wake up at my chosen time, when I lay down to go to sleep. I'll relax my body and then verbally (out loud) affirm that I'm going to wake up at my chosen time.

It has at least sometimes taken a few days to calibrate, but after that I will wake up automatically, within about a minute of my chosen time.

Calibrating: I wear a watch in bed so that when I wake up in the night / morning, I can check what time it is. Crucially, if it is within an hour of my chosen time, I'll get up, even if that is a bit early or a bit late. Over the course of a few days my mind and body will narrow the interval until I am waking up at my chosen time.

######Spring out of bed

I want to start well

I've trained my self to spring out of bed as soon as I wake up, so that I am standing and moving within a second or two of opening my eyes.

This is important because my bed is cozy. If I don't get up immediately, I'm apt to snuggle up in there and then fall asleep for another hour or two, pushing back my sleep schedule.

Furthermore, this allows to to start the day with momentum, which can carry through for hours.

You can do this with offline habit training: just practice (during the day, when you're fully awake), laying down in bed with your eyes closed, and then opening your eyes and jumping out of bed. Do 10 reps of this, being careful to reset after each one, so that you're not practicing *getting back into bed*, each time.

I've sometimes used a mantra in this moment as well, to remind me of my intention or why I care about getting up. When I was a teenager, I used to wake up at 5:00 AM to get up and meditate and do "energetic exercises" (as part of astral projection training). I used to say, as I got out of bed "this is what it means to be a wizard", particularly in the months when it was cold.

######Light first thing

When I wake up, I go outside to get light exposure, first thing, to firmly signal my wakeup time to my circadian system. I'll put on pants, and then take a walk around my literal block while I brush my teeth.

Early light exposure like this was recommended by Andrew Huberman here. He claims outdoor light exposure is --x more effective than sunlight through a window.


#####Engaging with conflicting intentions

Claim: Given that 1) it is my bedtime and 2) I have a normal end of the day sleep drive (eg I didn't take a 3 hour nap late in the day), if I am not falling asleep this is because I am executing conflicting intentions. There is always some part of me that is *resisting* falling asleep. Typically, when I look (actually more like feel) for it, I can find it. 

(As a side note, this is part of why having an unclear sleep schedule is poison...

Once I've felt that intention to do something other than go to sleep (often, an intention to think about something, or make progress on a problem), I'll decide whether I want to abort that intention or not. Often times, I'll opt to get up and write up notes about what I'm thinking about.

But if I want to drop whatever my other intention is and go to sleep, I'll follow the following protocol. 


**1. Still my body**

I find that when I am awake and my mind is churning on some problem, some part of my body will be moving

2. Mentally press down on my head and shoulders


3. Iteratively lengthen my breath


4. Lean into visual imagery



#####If I'm still restless

This doesn't always work however. If I've been lying in bed for 40 minutes or more, and haven't fallen asleep yet. However, when I get up like this, there are only three activities that I allow myself, so that I don't get hooked by something stimulating and stay up for an extra hour when I could have been asleep.

######Journal

I have a I have a chromebook that is set up just for journaling. I've blocked that everything except roam, google docs (for my tracking spreadsheets and forms), and toggl. 

This way, when I'm restless, I can get up and journal in Roam, typically outlining my thoughts about whatever I was thinking on, without the temptation of flipping to say, twitter.

######Meditate

Alternatively, I might get up and meditate for a few minutes.

######Drink Soylent 

Eating actives the parasympathetic and enteric nervous system, and is one way to calm sympathetic activation. That's why stress eating is a thing.

However, eating in the hours before bed harms sleep quality. So it isn't a good idea to eat just before bed.

However-however, my initial experiments suggest that liquid food doesn't worsen my sleep, so I'll sometimes have a bottle of soylent or non-dairy milk if I'm restless.

###Exercise

After sleep, the most important habit / behavior pattern for maintaining high energy is sufficient regular exercise. When I am exercising intensely enough, regularly, I feel more alert and energetic.

####Intensity

How much is “enough”? As a heuristic, I want to exercise hard enough that I break a sweat *or* I am at least a little bit sore the next day. 

####Regularity

In practice, it doesn't seem to make that much of a difference if I skip exercise for one day. But, if I go 3 or 4 days without being active, I'll tend to feel slightly slugish or generally unmotivated. And from this state, going to exercise feels more onerous. So I make a point to exercise almost every day, 

Miss once, but never miss twice. 

####What kind of exercise?

Years, ago, I was listening a podcast (the Freakenomics podcast?), in which they interviewed some expert on exercise and health, and he said something that stuck with me:

“The optimal kind of exercise is whatever you will actually do.”

The difference, in health, cognitive, and longevity outcomes, between exercising regularly and not is much larger than the difference between some form of exercise and some theoretically more efficient form of exercise. It is much more effective to find ways to exercise that you actually like than it is try and find the most efficient kind, since you’re more likely to form a habit around the exercise that you actually like.

I prefer forms of exercise that do not demand constant attention / exertion of will power  over the course of the activity. Practices for which, once I show up and start, the default is to keep going. 

Strength training is like this for me: once I’ve started I don’t really need to force myself to keep going, there’s a kind of rhythm to it, where as (again) for me, running feels like a continuous slog where I have to keep deciding not to stop. Juggling and playing beat-saber are similar.

Personally, my main exercise is Barbell training (squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses, bent over rows, bench press), and bodyweight exercises (pullups, chinups). I also often play beatsaber, which is super fun, with weights on my arms.

I find that squats are particularly important for some reason.


####Lowering activation energy to exercise

Exercise is the most important of the things that I aim to do just about every day. I want the transition to exercise to be a smooth and easy. As such it is worth it to debug and clear away any, even very slight, aversion or impediment to going to train. 

#####Debugging systemic aversions to exercise

The following are examples of slight / subtle aversions that turned out to be at root of a disinclination to exercise, and how I debugged them.

“My squat has been feeling weird and I have some fear that I’m hurting myself” -> I booked a session with a personal trainer to check my form

“I’m afraid to push my limit because I don’t have a spotter” -> I purchased spotter arms 

“It’s too hot out” -> I got a fan, and also switched to exercising at night

“It’s cold out” -> I started running and playing beatsaber instead of weight lifting.

#####Booting up from not exercising equilibrium

Occasionally, for one reason or another, I'll have fallen out of my regular rhythm, and I won't have exercised in a week or more. As noted, this is a kind of positive feedback system: when I'm in an equilibrium where I'm not exercising, going to exercise feels particularly onerous, but when I'm exercising regularly, going to exercise will usually feel attractive.

So when I'm attempting to boot up from one equilibrium to another, I'll try to find the easiest and most attractive form of exercise, to lower the required activation energy as much as possible. In practice this usually means playing beatsaber. 

#####Action Chunking

Sometimes, I will hit my trigger to go out an exercise (what the trigger is might vary day by day, but often it is my first work break), and I just won’t feel like it.

In this situation I default to “action chunking”: I’ll ask “what’s the smallest proximal next action that I need to do to go strength train?”, and then visualize that next step in my head. I find that just visualizing the action, over and over, tends to cause me to get up and execute the action. 

[Note: this seems related to unbundling clarification and execution]

For instance, if I’m sitting on the couch in the office, the first step to going to exercise is to stand up and press the button on the elevator. 

Or maybe the first thing that I need to do is walk into my room to put on socks. So I would visualize myself standing up, walking into that room, and looking in the directions of the socks.

Action chunking is usually sufficient to lower the activation energy to starting a chain of actions. And unless I have some particular aversion to exercising (see above), this causes me to flow into exercises. It snowballs, starting from a very minor action into pretty effortful (but natural-default) activity.

Like everything else, of course, the transition function for exercise is made more reliable by future pacing it. [link]

#####Amping up Pushing past dragginess

Sometimes I’ll be particularly tired or draggy, on a day, but I want to exercise anyway. To counteract my disinclination to exert myself, I’ll use my activation process to get into a slightly high-arousal mode. 

	**Activation Process:**
	
	1. 40 Pushups
	2. 3 sets of Bellows Breathing (20 breaths a set) 

Then, between sets, I’ll pace and take deep moderately-paced nasal breaths, to maintain a somewhat heightened level of physiological arousal. 

-------

In addition to all of the above, I have a policy that I don’t eat a second meal of the day unless I have done some exercise, even if it is just pullups. 

###Rest days

I didn't used to take explicit rest days. But I experimented with it, on the advice of Anna Salamon, and the difference in how I felt was noticeable. Remember, we are aiming for effective modes, not effective traits. If you never give yourself explicit time to rest (or don’t give yourself enough time), then you’ll tend to slack off during your work time. You want your work time to be high quality, which means supporting that work time with explicit rest time. These days, I take a rest day at least once a week.

In my parlance, a rest day is a day where I steer mainly by the question “what would be most nourishing right now?” / I don’t do anything that I don’t viscerally feel like doing, from the time I wake up to the time that I go to sleep (modulo taking a little bit of time in the evening to do a daily review and plan my next day).

I don’t exactly avoid using will power, since for instance, I might strength train hard, which does require some amount of will power, but it still feels “soft” or something.

Personally, on rest days I will often:

* Meditate
* Strength train
* go on walks
* Cook my own food
* Make music
* Start new side projects
* Read comic books
* Watch movies
* Sauna

The day after a rest day, the feeling of refreshedness is palpable. I subjectively feel more alert, and responsive, and energetic, and it is easier to focus.

####Theory

I’m not sure what the “active ingredient” of rest days are. I will sometimes spend much of a rest day doing pretty intense cognitive work on some side project, but nevertheless, I’ll feel notably refreshed the next day. This makes me think that the core thing is something like “dropping my psychological commitments” (in the GTD sense of the word “commitment”). Where usually some part of my mind is tracking all the things that need to happen and that I want to do, on a rest day, anytime a commitment “pings” me, I respond with “that’s not my responsibility today.”

[link to ‘pause your feedback loops’]

It is also possible that the active ingredient is just that I’m doing different things on rest days than on work days, 

[Dig deeper into intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and how it relates to energy levels.]

I haven’t figured out the optimal cadence of rest days yet. Presumably there is some frequency that maximizes my output, and I could find this number by simple binary search.

[link to ‘weekend Wednesdays’]

####Pre-restday space clearing

Because I want to turn off my sense of stress and pressure for a day, I need to explicitly process everything and put them all in their places, before the rest day starts. The goal is to deal with everything urgent, and make plans for the next workday, to deal with everything else.

#####Pre Rest day checklist:

1. Preparation (must be day before)
	1. Process personal email
	2. Process CFAR email
	3. Process reminders
	4. Process distraction notes
	5. Do a check for dangling threads / open loops. Deal with them, schedule them, or put them in a process.
	6. Schedule my next rest day.


###Day-level Energetic Rhythms

In general, I'm aiming to increase amplitude.


####Circadian rhythms

There's a circadian dip around 7 to 8 hours after wakeup time. Durring the dip 

####Eating depresses dampens / blunts energy

Eating food causes my energy to falter, which kills or slows momentum. 

This is probably because eating triggers digestion, which activates the parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems, at the expense of the sympathetic nervous system [link]. Lessened arousal results in lowered subjective energy [link].

In contrast, not eating can increase alertness.

Because of this, eating is not a neutral activity, that you can do casually, whenever. It's more like sleep: something that has a strong impact on your state, and which has its own rhythms to be attuned to. [I feel like I could improve this sentence.] 

Relating to food has a feeling of a sort of "push pull" dynamic too it, as if I'm riding a wave. If I time it right, I benefit from the alertness of being hungry, *and* from the restorative boost in blood sugar. When I time it poorly, I'll eat at semi-random times and it will slow me down to the point of being almost dead in the water. Eating should feel like the sort of thing that has a *rhythm.*

I don't eat during my main work periods. If I feel hungry during my work periods, I'll drink water or chew some gum. 

	TAP: Feel Hungry (during work) -> Chug water

Most days I will eat only one meal, in the middle of the day, at my circadian dip.


####Non-Sleep Deep Rest


Note: Set up multi-n experiment comparing Yoga-nidra to just lying down with your eyes closed for a similar amount of time. 

[Do an larger than n=1 experiment of yoga Nidra versus just lying down with your eyes closed, in terms of how restful or nourishing each is.]

##Attentional Habits and Modes

###Modes

####Deep Work

####Taut Task mode

One of the key modes [link to “modes, not states”] of my whole system is what I’m tetivevely calling “taut” executing intentions time. 

Roughly, this refers to a timebox in which my intentionality doesn’t lapse: every action is consciously selected, and I don’t engage in anything (during that timbox) that would distract or sap my metacognition. This mode is the main way I do individual tasks that that take an hour or less to complete (as opposed to work that requires long uninterrupted blocks / as opposed to deep work [either way, link to deep work].

(I consider this mode a more specific version of the Executing Intentions mindset that we teach at CFAR workshops. In just executing intentions, you’re free to do whatever you want, as long as you consciously choose it. This TEI time is work time for me, and I’m focused on making work progress in particular.)

I call this taut executing intentions time, because it has a phenomenology of just a slight amount of tension. There’s a sense of something that I’m not allowing to go slack. There’s a persistent sense of slight urgency.
The key components of taut the executing intations:

* Every action is deliberate and intentional
* Maintain the metacognitive thread
* Decouple energy from intentionality
* Keep arousal high
* Avoid rabbit holes and wasted motions

#####Every action is deliberate and intentional

In this mode, I don’t allow myself to lackadaisically do something, and then find something else interesting and shift to something else. The senes of “what I’m doing right now” is crisp. I’m allowed, at any time, or for any reason, to shift what I’m doing, but the decision to do so must be deliberate and explicit.

in support of this, I will usually narrate my steering-decisions out loud to myself: 

Ok, I was looking at my email and I received a newsletter, so I’m now going to switch to reading and taking notes on that.

or 

I just realized that I need to get a new key made before I leave, and the place might be closed tomorrow. I’m going switch to checking that … ok. I’m going to go to the key-maker place now.

This sort of narration is also helpful for dealing with ambiguity. [include this? Say more?]

I also track all of my time with toggl track, which gives the affordance for this kind of explicitness.

#####Maintain the metacognitive thread
I call this taut executing intiontions time, because it has a phenomenology of just a slight amount of tension. There’s a sense of something that I’m not allowing to go slack. There’s a persistent sense of slight urgency.

Basically, at no point in the timebox do I “put down” the meta-intention of being conscious and deliberate about my actions. Even as I’m engaged in a task there’s a part of me that’s keeping track of my meta-intention, and has a sense , so that if I start to go down a rabbit hole, or finish some specific task, I don’t just drift, but rather re-assess and choose.

There’s a kind of consistent metacognitive thread that is alive from the beginning of the timebox to the end of the timebox.

Because of this, there are a few activities that I don’t engage in at all when I’m in this mode.

#####No audiobooks or podcasts 

I’ll sometimes listen to audiobooks while I’m walking places or when I’m doing menial tasks like cleaning my space or while I’m pooping (I do this much less now, since I started taking notes on pretty much everything I read or listen to).

But I don’t do this in an TEI block, because listening to audio sucks me away from my task context, and into the content of the audio. It kicks out the metacognitive thread, and replaces it with a different thread; that of the story or conversation.

#####No social media

Social media is amazingly effective as sucking away my intentionality. Twitter is filled with little hooks that catch my attention and pull me away from whatever I was thinking about or trying to do. So I likewise don’t use social media during TEI blocks.
No eating food
Eating food can also be a way to 
Decouple energy from intentionality
Oftentimes, I’ve treated feeling tired or low energy as an excuse for slouching off, and and letting the crispness of my intention for what I’m currently doing melt / degrade / leak. 

One of the key pieces of the TEI mindset is that you don’t allow yourself to do this. You should certainly take your energy level into account in deciding what to do, but you do not allow your low energy to be an excuse for keeping intentionality high.

When I feel drained or low energy in a TEI block, I insist on maintaining intentionality anyway, and I move to do something that will recoup my energy (most basically, exercising).
Keep arousal high
I speculate that a part of the tautness that is being maintained is slightly heightened physiological arousal. You’re just a little bit activated.

For this reason, I don’t eat anything during TEI blocks, because eating puts me in a rest and digest mode that lowers arousal and mutes my sense of forward momentum. 

One side benefit of not eating: I would sometimes use making or eating food as a coping strategy. There’s something that some part of me wants to avoid, at least a little bit, and going to make food and eat it gives me something to procrastinate with. Having a temporary moratorium of eating, means that I notice when I have the urge to go make food, so that I can double click on it and tease out the aversion.
Avoid rabbit holes and wasted motions
In this mode, I want to be particularly on the ball about not wasting time or going down low value rabbit holes. My goal is to get the key things done as quickly as possible.

This part is a little bit new fow me, but my current plan is to train this to just note, in roam, every time I start to go down, or consider going down a rabbit hole. 

#####Noticing Aversions

One advantage of maintaining a state with explicitly high metacognition and deliberateness is that it sharpens my focus of subtle aversions, to tasks (particularly ambiguity aversions). When your intentionality is vague it is harder to notice when you’re avoiding something. But if you’re being explicit about what you intention is at any given point, and you’re crisply deciding what to do next, it stands out more starkly if there’s something you’re shying away from.

From that noticing, I’ll double click on the aversion, and tease out its structure. [link]

I first wrote about this mode [here](https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/2020/02/10/modes-not-traits-and-decoupling-cognitive-energy-from-intentionality/).

####Rest



###Techniques for Starting

There’s a sort of momentum effect, whereby once I get into the flow of work, it feels natural to keep going. Focused execution is an attractor state, as is distracted 

For this reason one the most important things is entering the attractor state in the first place: starting work on whatever it is so that momentum can take over. 

I’ve found that there are a couple of strategies that are helpful for this.


####TAP Chains for starting work
Each evening, when I outline my daily goals for the next day, I’ll outline and future pace my “morning TAP chain”. That is, I’ll clarify the sequence of actions that I want to move through in the first hour or so after waking up, and step through them in my mind.

Typically, this involves waking up, brushing my teeth, meditating, and possibly exercising, before opening up my laptop to look at my daily goals. 

Sometimes I’ll set a TAP to set a timer as soon as I wake up, and an intention to be working by the time the timer rings.

Note that I am mentally rehearsing this series of actions in advance, and setting TAPs from one to the other, so that the whole chain flows automatically. 

Obviously, lots of people have morning routines, which can accomplish the same effect, with less overhead, but somewhat less flexibility.

I need some similar process for my evening blocks as well, but I’m not sure how to implement that yet.

####Just start mulling

Sometimes a project will feel really big and daunting, such that I shy away from sitting down and working on it. Or I’ll sit down to write, and the words feel sort of stilted, instead of flowing.

When this happens I’ll start by just mulling over the task or project. Usually, I’ll go for a walk, and start mumbling to myself or thinking to myself about the project. I’m not trying to DO anything, I’m just sort of booting it up.

Eventually I find that it sort of takes hold: I start composing good sentences in my head, or producing avenues of attack on the problem that seem compelling to try. This builds up a kind of pressure, as I want to get back to my computer and start working with those ideas.

More specific TAP: Feel some avoidance or "too big to fit"ness, about the next thing to do -> take a walk and start musing about it


####Wedging in

When I need to go from low momentum to high, I start with the thing that feels easiest, not the thing that is most important.

Do anki review, because that is short enough low effort enough that I always feel willing to do it, and because once I've done it, I've got my foot in the door for doing my daily things.

####"Getting a taste" for something

####Using a chess timer

####Coworking

Another strategy that is effective for starting the ball on work is sitting down with another person. Having one other person sets social context, and changes the immediate-term incentives so that the default action becomes “work”, instead of “fuck around”

One logistically easy way to setup coworking is focusmate.

I’m currently experimenting with using focusmate to anchor my daily review sessions (because they’re so important that I want to make sure that they happen.

###Responding to Aversions

In my experience, aversions are by far the dominating factor in my personal productivity. When I don't have any aversions, I can pretty easily get into a state of clipping rapidly through tasks, flowing from one thing to another, for hours at a time. Life feels smooth, and action is efficient. But if I have even one aversion, to something that I think I should do, in the mix, it acts as a sort of speed bump, slowing everything down, as I take (rationalized) actions that divert me from the aversive stimulus, instead of moving getting things done as efficiently and effectively as possible.

Many productivity resources focus extensively on "overcoming procrastination." I claim that any instance of procrastination always has at least one aversion, at least one aversion that is core to its structure. Because of this, a fully reliable mechanism for processing aversions, would preempt all procrastination.

Therefore dealing with aversions, learning to noticing them, and responding to them smoothly, is the highest priority for one's personal productivity system.

By "aversion", I mean any sort of avoidance behavior. In the context of personal productivity, an aversion is any state in which there's something that you want to do, or think you should do, that some part of you is avoiding doing, or thinking about.

####Phenomenology of aversions

There are two main phenomenological flavors of aversion, for me.
The first is bodily / physiological response / contraction. For me, this almost always comes in the form of a physical clench in my belly, or occasionally, tightness in my chest. This is accompanied by or part of a fear, stress, or anxiety. Over the course of 2016, I learned to notice every time there was a felt-sense / bodily something, so I now have a good habit of reliably what's happening in my belly. This means that I almost never fail to notice and aversion, because I notice the physiological response first.

But sometimes aversions are not evident in the form of a bodily clench. I call this second type of aversion phenomenology "glancing off", or slight resistance. It's much more subtle, characterized by a sort of mental swerve around the task or action. I can notice this phenomenology most specifically, when I have a new task to do, and ask "how about I do it right now?". If there is nothing logistically stopping me from getting it done right now, but I "don't feel like it", this is a glancing off aversion. (There's a sort of tendency with glancing off aversions to spread work out over as much time as is feasible, which often results in performing at a third or a tenth of your full capacity.)

In addition to phenomenological cues, you can use behavioral tells to alert you that you're avoiding something. For me, Watching TV shows, or casually watching youtube videos that the algorithm suggests to me (in contrast to specific videos for specific purposes), is a signal/ flag that some part of my systems are failing. Usually, it's either a sign of something that I'm averse to, or that my mechanisms for maintaining mental energy have broken down.

Common content of aversions:

[this section should probably go after the next section?]

Aversions always have a specific internal structure. There's always a logic to why some part of you is averse to something, as opposed to the aversion being a brute, irreducible fact about the world. That is, aversions can always be interpreted to be or to depend on beliefs about the world. As I'll discus in the next section, processing aversions basically always entails some process of dialogue with the part of you experiencing the aversion, to clarify, specifically what's bad, and then dealing with, or planning around that bad thing.
The following are some common aversions structures, categories of reasons why a task or thought might be bad. Note that these categories represent clusters, and there may not be clear cut distinctions between them: an aversion might be reasonably considered to be an instance of more than one of these categories.

- **Discomfort**: a very simple kind of an aversion is that caused by an expectation of physical discomfort. For instance, if I don't have a chair (for some reason), and have to sit on the ground, I'm going to be resistant to doing writing work, which will entail sitting in an uncomfortable posture.
	- For these, you want to adjust your environment to sidestep the discomfort, by getting a chair for instance
- To big / too ambiguous: Sometimes a task will be "too big to conceptualize", or mentally conceptualized as a single brute object, lacking detail.
(The thing to do with with such aversions is chunk out to [[next action]] ([[action chunking]]). Usually, if I can visualize the next step concretely, it's easier to flow into that task).
A scary choice: sometimes I'll be avoiding some task because it involves making some painful tradeoff, or making some large decision about which I am afraid of making a mistake.
(Here, I would want to "let in reality" [[Letting in reality]], and absorb the fact of the tradeoff, and then do )
I've already messed up / I'm behind : This is an especially common one. If a person is a little behind on a task, or they know that they should have done it some time ago, they'll get a micro hedonic sting every time they think about the task, and therefore avoid it.
Again, let in reality.
Overwhelm: "There are too many things pulling on my attention, or too many things that I need to track"
Go meta and organize everything you need to track. (I do this by outlining on notecards.)
I'm going to fail: Another common one. If you think that a project is doomed, you'll be resistant to think about it, and to put effort into it.
This bad for my goals: This is a really important one. Sometimes a task is bad because it threatens something important to you. It's esspecially critical
My extended working memory is already full, or I don't have the mental space or the time to load this project up, and make progress on it. (A subset of "I'm unmotivated, because this isn't going to work.")
Boredom?
Distraction
Clearly, sometimes I'm anxious, due to an aversion and this causes me to flinch away into a distraction activity like watching youtube, reading blogs, or masturbating. Sometimes, this seems to diffuse the anxiety.
I think that watching TV / reading blogs / whatever, works to defuse anxiety to the extent that you actually successfully distract yourself, and become engaged enough in the new activity that you actually manage to drop the initial fear that was being held by your felt sense.

####Dealing with aversions

A system that deals with aversions must have two parts: you have to notice aversions when they arise, and you have to do something productive with them.

Noticing: I've already mentioned the phenomenological cues for recognizing aversions, but you need to learn to notice them. This is not any different than any other kind of [[noticing]].
Processing: Having noticed an aversion, you have to engage with it. Basically, you'll need to dialogue with the aversion until you have enough context to design a plan that serves the both your explicit, considered goals, and the goals of the aversion.
The main mechanism for dialogue is [[Gendlin Focusing]].
However, sometimes it's hard to get clarity on what the aversion is about via purely introspective methods, in that way. In those cases, I'll transition to a [[CoZE]], gently experimenting with the thing that I'm averse to, in carful and time-boxed way. If the aversion is a matter of ambiguity, or is built up of of imagined (not very truth tracking) fears, it may simply disappear. If not, I'll usually get more context on what exactly is bad about the thing.
There are occasional contexts where it makes senes to simply push through and aversion, but this is not very stable in the even the medium run, and unless the aversion dissolves in contact with reality, you're apt to loose most of your efforts
Experimental CoZE-ing

Sometimes I'll try doing Focusing on an aversion, and be unable to get a handle (hah!) on what the aversion is about. In that case, one thing that I might do is start the relevant task, not with an attitude of forcing myself to do it, but

###Attention environment:
    - Spaces to work undisturbed
    - Tools for control dopamine-triggering attention hooks 
    - GTD

###State modulation

####Sleep Deprivation

- Amp up and then move to a high cadence task.



####Slow / tired / draggy

- During a work period: Amp up 
- In between a work period: Yoga nidra

####Cognitively tired / worn out

- Yoga Nidra
- Exercise

####Stimulation hunger

Triggers
- Browsing youtube
- listening to audiobooks

-> Lie down with eyes closed 

####Fuzzy-headed

	TAP: Feel Fuzzy-headed -> Move toward exercise

####Headache 

	TAP: Notice headache -> Get electrolyte water

As soon as I notice that I have a headache, I'll drink a large glass of electrolyte water.

Dehydration is not always the cause, but it is a good enough bet, that it is worth it hydrate without delay. It's possible I was imagining it, but I've sometimes felt reprieve within about two minutes.

####Agitated

####Compulsive / Impulsive

Feel into the body sensation of the compulsiveness


###Intention awareness

####Fastidious Time Tracking

###Opportunity Cost Awareness

###Notes on my ideal living setup

- Three spaces, all in separate buildings within 1 to 3 blocks of each other
	- Sleeping space
		- I have a light insulated closet or cubby to sleep in
			- It has very good ventilation
			- It has good temperature control, and I can set the temperature low.
		- I have a shower and a sauna nearby.
	- Deep work space
		- Standing desk
		- Big monitor (that connects wirelessly?)
		- Kneeling chair
		- Multiple big whiteboards	
		- Backjack to sit in
		- No food in the space
		- I can be assured of not being disturbed
		- There's a nap place nearby	
	- Food and socializing space
	- Squat rack (can be in or near any of the three space?)
