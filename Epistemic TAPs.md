### Motivated cognition:

- Notice and flag when I have a thought that is something that I want to believe (eg self-aggrandizing, flattering, ego-boosting, comforting, etc.), and then ask myself what the evidence for that thought is
  - Example: I have the thought "I'm now on track, and acquiring knowledge, the way that I wanted to for years."
  - Example: Sydney and I don't make progress together, but there's a small number of things that would need to change than then we would just work well together.
  - [[Exercise and TAP: Noticing thoughts that I want or like to believe, flagging, and then asking for the evidence]]

### Doing something other than trying to get the right answer

- Notice when I'm "telling stories", or rehearsing having an impact on someone, instead of figuring out what's true.
  - [[TAP]]: Notice myself "telling stories" -> flagging gesure
- Notice when it feels like I'm "straining" in arguing for something -> Pause and ask if I think it is actually true.
  - 

### Social decoupling

- Flag when someone says something that is aligned with their incentives
  - [[Exercise and TAP: Flagging when someone says something that is aligned with their incentives]]
- What is the trigger for imagining that everyone is in a conspiracy to "punk me"

### Quantitative thinking

- When I use the phrase "order of magnitude", "a lot", or other phrases invoking quantity or quantitative comparison, I flag it, pause, and do a fermi estimate or look up the number.

- Simple strategies for countering hindsight bias
  - Writing down predictions before someone tells you something.

### Generating multiple hypotheses

- What should the trigger be for generating another hypothesis
- I think I want to have a practice of noticing when I should generate multiple hypotheses and then write them down on paper.

### Dealing with fear of possible worlds / noticing and defusing triggeredness

- Lines of retreat
- Deflinching

### Not pretending to Undertand

- Notice and flag if I'm acting from a sense of awkwardness, or avoiding awkwardness, or avoiding conflict.
  - Notice and flag when I'm displaying as if I know or understand something, to socially smooth
    - [[TAP: Noticing pretending to know]]

### Honesty

- [[TAP]]: Something that that isn't literally true slips out in conversation -> I reflect out loud and determine what I should have said instead. 

### Other:

- Noticing and flagging my fleeting mental imagry when planning, deciding, or discussing.

- Verbally flagging when I'm doing making/using a question substitution
  - 
- Flag the implicit intention impress / hope for acclimation or approbation

- Noticing flinches
  - Notice myself flinching away from a thought -> Flagging gesture, write it down
- Flagging [[cat couplings]]

- Maybe I want to have a technique of noticing when something happens that might be important, and generating hypotheses about how I might want to respond to that.
